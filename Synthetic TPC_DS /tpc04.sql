/***********************************************************
This procedure is generated by the query 51 template
in TPC-DS. This query is to compute the count of store sales 
resulting from promotions, the count of all store sales and 
their ratio for specific categories in a particular time 
zone and for a given year and month.
The sclar parameter is dms.

The detail steps for generating the procedure with loops
by transforming CTE query are as follows. Each CTE table
variable is transformed to the SQL assignment statement.
Then, each query with table variables is decomposed.
Finally, for each scalar parameter that is used in the query
template, the loop, which calculates the query iteratively for
every range of parameter, is inserted. 

group by operation in while clause can push down in v1 & v2
